## Define the followint terms:
* object, The parts that the model is built from
* class, Describes the kind of object(s)
* instance, Particular object
* method, The entries in a menu that represent operations that you can use to manipulate
* signature, The name of a method and the parameter types found in its header
* parameter, Additional values that some methods require
* type, Defines what kinds of values a parameter can take
* state, The values in fields
* source code, Determines the structure and behavior of each object of the class
* return value, Information returned from the method about an object
* compiler, Program that takes the code written and translates it for the computer

## In Chapter 1 we have mentioned the data types int and String. Java has more predefined data types. Find out what they are and what they are used for. To do this, you can check Appendix B, or look it up in another Java book or in an online Java language manual. One such manual is at [http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html](http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html)

## What are the types of the following values?

* 0     int
* "hello"  string
* 101   int
* -1  int
* true   boolean
* "33"   string
* 3.1415   float/double

## What would you have to do to add a new field, for example one called name, to a circle object?
I would add code to where the object circle is.
## Write the header for a method named send that has one parameter of type String, and does not return a value.
public void send(String s)
## Write the header for a method named average that has two parameters, both of type int, and returns an int value.
public int average(int one,int two)
## Look at the book you are reading right now. Is it an object or a class? If it is a class, name some objects. If it is an object, name its class.
Pages, Pictures, Titles
## Can an object have several different classes? Discuss.
An object can be referenced from many classes as long as it is imported.
